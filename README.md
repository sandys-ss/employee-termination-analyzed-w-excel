## 4. Conclusion

Based on the analysis of employee termination data, it is known that there is a trend of employee growth from 2011 to 2013. However, in 2014 and 2015 the number of employees continued to decline. This happened because the company carried out a layoff policy in 2014 (142 employees) or around 2.9% of total employees and 2015 (73 employees) or 1.5% of total employees in that year. This layoff policy is also mostly imposed on employees with more than 10 years of service with an average age of 51 years, where in the Customer Service division the average age is 28 years and in Accounting the average age is 65 years. In addition, the number of employees who are most often terminated are employees from the Store business unit, namely in the Meats, Produce and Customer Service departments.
